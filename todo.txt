CRUCIAL DEV

// Post Link & Link to Reddit comments page

// Settings panel

// highlight OP in thread (need to bind directive to CommentsCtrl)


BUGS & ISSUES

// PostsCtrl and CommentsCtrl are very similar and very heavy

// Posts and comments aren't ordered correctly since they're properties bound to object, switching to array forces DOM refresh on all posts/comments


FEATURES TO ADD

// Chat style comment thread

// Comment Filters (Post filters?)

// load default settings from JSON file

// NBA icon flair and username/team colors

// Notification sound
